            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p>Despite the fact that a little goes a long way, you may be tempted to overindulge, given the wonderful
                combination of crust and cake. The rich, buttery crumble top contains warm spices, with just enough
                sugar to give it a bit of crunch. The cake itself is moist and flavorful, the ideal companion to coffee
                or tea.

                Try it with breakfast, or with afternoon tea, or even as an accompaniment to after-dinner coffee hour.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, cut into 6 pieces</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/3 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>Confectioners’ sugar for dusting (optional) </li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons butter, melted and still warm</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups cake flour</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the topping, combine the sugars, cinnamon, and melted butter. Add the flour and stir until the
            mixture
            is smooth. Set aside to cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the cake, preheat oven to 325° F. Grease an 8” square baking dish and line with parchment, allowing
            extra to
            hang over the sides. This extra will help lift the cake out of the pan once it is baked.

        </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly. Break apart the crumb topping and
            sprinkle
            over the top of the batter in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake until the crumbs are golden, and a toothpick comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool on a rack for at
            least
            30 minutes more, then remove the cake from the pan by lifting out the parchment. </li>
        <li>Serve warm or at room temperature. Ice cream makes a wonderful accompaniment. </li>
    </ol>
